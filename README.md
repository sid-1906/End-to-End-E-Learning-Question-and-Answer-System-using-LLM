## End-to-End-E-Learning-Question-and-Answer-System-using-LLM
This project is an end-to-end question and answer system designed to assist an e-learning company. The system leverages a large language model (LLM) to automatically provide responses to student inquiries, particularly for repetitive or frequently asked questions.

#Key Features:-
1.Automated Q&A: The system efficiently answers questions about courses, fees, and other related topics.
2.Contextual Responses: It can combine information from multiple sources to provide a single, coherent, and comprehensive answer.
3.Intelligent Retrieval: The system uses a vector database and text embeddings to quickly find the most relevant information for a given question.
4.Knowledge Gaps: The system is designed to identify when it lacks the necessary information to provide a good answer, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
5.User-Friendly Interface: A simple web application built with Streamlit allows for easy interaction.


#Technical Stack
1.Framework: LangChain for orchestrating the LLM application.
2.LLM: Google Palm for generating intelligent responses.
3.Embeddings: Hugging Face for creating text embeddings.
4.Vector Database: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for storing and retrieving information.
5.User Interface: Streamlit for creating the web application.


#Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1.A Google Account to access Makersuite.
2.A Google Palm API key.
3.Python 3.7 or newer installed.
